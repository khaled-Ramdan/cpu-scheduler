There is no real installation of this package,
because you may use this to create your own programs.

There  is a file called 'monitor.c', use 'make monitor'<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<IMPORTANT

Use 'make ' to compile all files, excepted 'monitor.c',
then you can include the Librarys and headers to your 
own programs.

Finally: have fun with it.
